Summary:
My presentation revolves around explaining how modern Search Engines function and its relation to Discrete Mathematical principles. I cover how Boolean Algebra is used within search query processing. The video then explains how Search Engine uses bots to crawl through the internet and how it is modeled using graph theory. I explain how indexing is done through the principles of set theory to categorize and store information. The PageRank algorithm is then explained as central to rank webpages for search results. The presentation is concluded by going over how machine learning has been implemented to give better search results.
